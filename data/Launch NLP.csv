Description,Title
"India is the world's third-largest producer and third largest consumer of electricity. The national electric grid in India has an installed capacity of 370.106 GW as of 31 March 2020. Renewable power plants, which also include large hydroelectric plants, constitute 35.86% of India's total installed capacity.
India has a surplus power generation capacity but lacks adequate distribution infrastructure.

India's electricity sector is dominated by fossil fuels, in particular coal, which during the 2018-19 fiscal year produced about three-quarters of the country's electricity. The government is making efforts to increase investment in renewable energy. The government's National Electricity Plan of 2018 states that the country does not need more non-renewable power plants in the utility sector until 2027, with the commissioning of 50,025 MW coal-based power plants under construction and addition of 275,000 MW total renewable power capacity after the retirement of nearly 48,000 MW old coal-fired plants.

India has recorded rapid growth in electricity generation since 1985, increasing from 179 TW-hr in 1985 to 1,057 TW-hr in 2012. The majority of the increase came from coal-fired plants and non-conventional renewable energy sources (RES), with the contribution from natural gas, oil, and hydro plants decreasing in 2012-2017. The gross utility electricity generation (excluding imports from Bhutan) was 1,384 billion kWh in 2019-20, representing 1.0 % annual growth compared to 2018-2019. The contribution from renewable energy sources was nearly 20% of the total. In the year 2019-20, all the incremental electricity generation is contributed by renewable energy sources as the power generation from fossil fuels decreased.
The drivers for India's electricity sector are its rapidly growing economy, rising exports, improving infrastructure, and increasing household incomes.",Daily Power Generation in India (2017-2020)

"Context
Climate change refers to both global warming driven by human emission of greenhouse gases, as well as the rise in environmental disasters induced by said warming. For the past few decades, this issue has been a plague on the conscious of humanity, as it grapples over how to handle this existential threat. On one hand, the scientific community is frustrated by the lack of initiative by governments to curb fossil fuel emissions and widespread mortality, which is projected to happen by the end of the century. On the other, policymakers have to strike a precarious balance between meeting short-term needs, such as ensuring annual economic growth and low unemployment, as well as long-term planning against the effects of climate change, through measures such as renewable energy investment and reforestation.

Climate change policies, unfortunately, often do not lend themselves to immediate economic advantage, and in fact usually have significant costs associated with them. For instance, renewable energies require a sizable initial investment to reach scale, and have only recently become competitive with fossil fuel production costs. Another point of contention for climate change policies are the inequities associated with them. In my opinion, these can be broadly surmised into two questions, namely:

1) How can we ensure that the positive impact of climate change measures will affect all demographics, especially the most vulnerable?

2) How do we prevent the economic drawbacks of climate change policies from harming those from lower socio-economic groups?

For question 2, for instance, a national shift from fossil fuel to renewable energy sources may hurt the manufacturing sector, which could result in the loss of many blue-collar jobs.",Compiled datasets for CDP Analytics Competition
"This data has been gathered at two solar power plants in India over a 34 day period. It has two pairs of files - each pair has one power generation dataset and one sensor readings dataset. The power generation datasets are gathered at the inverter level - each inverter has multiple lines of solar panels attached to it. The sensor data is gathered at a plant level - single array of sensors optimally placed at the plant.

There are a few areas of concern at the solar power plant -

Can we predict the power generation for next couple of days? - this allows for better grid management
Can we identify the need for panel cleaning/maintenance?
Can we identify faulty or suboptimally performing equipment?",Solar Power Generation Data

"Context
India is the world's third-largest producer and third-largest consumer of electricity. The national electric grid in India has an installed capacity of 370.106 GW as of 31 March 2020. Renewable power plants, which also include large hydroelectric plants, constitute 35.86% of India's total installed capacity. During the 2018-19 fiscal year, the gross electricity generated by utilities in India was 1,372 TWh and the total electricity generation (utilities and non-utilities) in the country was 1,547 TWh. The gross electricity consumption in 2018-19 was 1,181 kWh per capita.
In 2015-16, electric energy consumption in agriculture was recorded as being the highest (17.89%) worldwide. The per capita electricity consumption is low compared to most other countries despite India having a low electricity tariff.

In light of the recent COVID-19 situation, when everyone has been under lockdown for the months of April & May the impacts of the lockdown on economic activities have been faced by every sector in a positive or a negative way.
With the electricity consumption being so crucial to the country, we came up with a plan to study the impact on energy consumption state and region wise.

The dataset is exhaustive in its demonstration of energy consumption state wise.

"Problem statement

It is the year 2021 and we are at the verge of a massive climatic change. With global warming at its peak and fossil fuels inching towards its extinction, it is the need of the hour to step up and take responsibility for our planet. Developing countries all over the world are making a shift towards a cleaner energy source and are looking at ways to expand their global energy source power.

Switching to renewable energy sources is a great way to reduce dependency on imported fuels and increase cost efficiency. It is time we move towards a low-carbon future by embracing solar, hydro, geothermal energy and so on, to protect mother nature.

An efficient energy source that has been gaining popularity around the world is wind turbines. Wind turbines generate power by capturing the kinetic energy of the wind. Factors such as temperature, wind direction, turbine status, weather, blade length, and so on influence the amount of power generated.",A Fine Windy Day

The data are anonymized by aggregating the Zipcodes so that every entry describes at least 10 connections.

This market is not competitive, meaning that the zones are assigned. This means that every year they roughly provide energy to the same zipcodes.

"The TMY3s are data sets of hourly values of solar radiation and meteorological elements for a 1-year period. Their intended use is for computer simulations of solar energy conversion systems and building systems to facilitate performance comparisons of different system types, configurations, and locations in the United States and its territories. Because they represent typical rather than extreme conditions, they are not suited for designing systems to meet the worst-case conditions occurring at a location.

Please note that TMY3 is NOT the state of the art solar data. It was used as a key component of investment analyses for several years, but NREL has released a more recent version based on satellite data and updated meteorological models that provides coverage for the entire United States. That dataset is much too large to publish here, but is highly recommended if you need the best information.

Please see the pdf manual for full details of each field; there are several dozen of them.
It's important to know that nearly all of the solar data is modeled based on estimates of cloud cover; less than 1% of the stations directly measured sunlight.
This data is not appropriate for time series analysis. A typical meteorological year is literally twelve months of real data from twelve different years. Please see the manual for further details.
